Description: Infer biological pathway activity of cells from single-cell RNA-sequencing data by calculating a pathway score for each cell (pathway genes are specified by the user). It is recommended to have the data in Transcripts-Per-Million (TPM) or Counts-Per-Million (CPM) units for best results. Scores may change when adding cells to or removing cells off the data. SiPSiC stands for Single Pathway analysis in Single Cells.
