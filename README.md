# SiPSiC
Cell-specific pathway score calculation from single-cell RNA sequencing data.
The Single Pathway analysis in Single Cells (SiPSiC) package is used to infer biological pathway activity of the individual cells included in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset. 
The dataset and list of genes comprising the pathway of interest are provided by the user, then per-cell pathway scores are calculated for all cells by the 'getPathwayScores' function.
SiPSiC is dependent upon R's 'Matrix' package available on CRAN.
